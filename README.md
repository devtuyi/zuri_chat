# Task:
You are to create a simple chat platform.
The chat platform should allow at least 2 people to chat with each other.
You don't have to use any form of database, but when I close my browser and I re-open it, I should resume back to my chat history until I click on "log out of chat" before I lose chat history. (or if I stay away from the chat platform for more than 30 minutes, then I lose chat history).
You can deploy anywhere you like, but you'll be required to submit both the code and the deployed testable link.
@channel Use any library or framework or language that you are comfortable with
